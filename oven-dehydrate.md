## Drying Instructions

### Oven Method
- Preheat oven to 200°F.

### Smoker Method
- Use lump charcoal only.
- Add 4 or 5 hickory chunks.
- Stay between 200–225°F.

## Preparation
- Insert jerky strips onto wood skewers.
- About 7 or 8 strips of jerky per skewer.
- Don't let them touch for best drying.
- Lay skewers perpendicular to the grate of the smoker or rack of the oven.
- Jerky will hang through so keep grates as high as you can.
- Keep enough space between skewers to allow for even air flow and smoke.
- Place aluminium foil on the bottom of the oven to catch drippings.

## Drying Time
- Open the oven door a few inches to let moisture escape every 20 minutes.
- Once air is dry enough then leave oven closed.
- No need to vent the smoker.
- The dry should take about 3 to 4 hours[^1].
- Jerky should be chewy but not wet.
- Taste pieces starting at 3 hours and wait until desired doneness.

## Storage
- Remove jerky from skewers and let cool.
- Try not to eat it all before it goes in bags.
- Place the cooled jerky in paper lunch bags.
- Single or double bag it.
- Share with friends.
