After you've let the meat sit for twelve hours in the refrigerator, it's time to dehydrate and air-frying is one way. There are more methods to come.

Configure you air fryer to dehydrate setting if it has one and select four hours of duration and 150-170 degrees F. Start the air fryer and wait for it to finish. After that, simply enjoy!

Note: 150-170F is a range and will vary across air fryers. Try 170 to be safe and reduce next time if this produces too dry a result.
